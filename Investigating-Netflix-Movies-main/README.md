#A DataCamp Project: Investigating Netflix Movies

In the era of information, data is a powerful tool for making informed decisions and developing meaningful insights. However, it is also a double-edged sword. The ease of accessing data and charts can lead us to fall into the trap of misinformation if we are not vigilant.

Often, when graphing data hastily or without analyzing the complete source, we can draw wrong conclusions and mislead others with incorrect interpretations. Charts can be powerful, but only when they are based on accurate and well-founded information.

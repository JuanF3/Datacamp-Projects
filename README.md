## A DataCamp Project: Investigating Netflix Movies

In the era of information, data is a powerful tool for making informed decisions and developing meaningful insights. However, it is also a double-edged sword. The ease of accessing data and charts can lead us to fall into the trap of misinformation if we are not vigilant.

When graphing data hastily or without analyzing the complete source, we can often draw wrong conclusions and mislead others with incorrect interpretations. Charts can be powerful, but only based on accurate and well-founded information.

## The Android App Market on Google Play

Load, clean, and visualize scraped Google Play Store data to gain insights into the Android app market.

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this project, you will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. You'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:

apps.csv: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app. user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.

## What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses


The oldest businesses in the world
This is Staffelter Hof Winery, Germany's oldest business, which was established in 862 under the Carolingian dynasty. It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time? Image credit: Martin Kraft The entrance to Staffelter Hof Winery, a German winery established in 862.

To help answer this question, BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company that is still in business in almost every country and compiled the results into a dataset. Let's explore this work to to better understand these historic businesses. Our datasets, which are all located in the datasets directory, contain the following information:

## A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?

Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.

Some results:

## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands!

In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.

**Proportion of deaths before and after the importance of handwashing**

## Predicting Credit Card Approvals

We'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:

First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
The attached notebook contains all the procedure
